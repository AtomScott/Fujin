# Message to myself

Parsing text will soon become a headache and you'll loose a lot of time, so don't work on this during work hours!
It seems straight forward and easy, but it isn't quite!

## Good idea needs work

It's a neat idea but I think you want to find some better way to accomplish the same thing.

I think if you're going to dig any deeper, you're better off using nbdev and working on something ideal based on their work.

How are you going to solve referencing?
What about templating? css?

Kramdown takes in html with a markdown tag so do that!

Change the fujin to simply give us Numpydoc parsed items and ほかはjinjaに流し込め．
そうしたらそんなに難しくないだろう．

もうこのプロジェクトは来週まで触らない！procastination厳禁！！
